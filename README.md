# Trading Engine Demo

This project is a demo of a stock order processing engine.

The author was responsible for developing a stock order processing system that demanded extremely high performance. The order processing module was implemented in C++ and utilized a multi-threaded, multi-stage pipeline architecture to meet performance requirements.

In recent years, Rust has gained significant attention for its excellent memory safety features while delivering performance comparable to C++. This makes it a compelling choice for developers seeking to write safer and more reliable programs.

The primary goal of this demo is to investigate whether Rust can achieve the same level of performance as C++ in developing the aforementioned order processing module while offering substantial improvements in safety.


There is a PowerPoint [presentation](doc/rust%20introduce%20and%20application%20of%20trading%20system.md) 
created by the author after thorough research, designed to introduce Rust to team members and showcase the runtime performance of the demo.
